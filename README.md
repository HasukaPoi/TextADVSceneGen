Originally as the rewrite of [GalSceneGenerator](https://github.com/HasukaPoi/GalSceneGenerator).

## What it can do
- Simply generate a text-ADV-like scene, using inputs of background image and senario text.
- Based on Canvas in HTML5 and JavaScript, which supported by modern web browsers.
- The style of dialog box and toolbar base on *Hanasaki Work Spring* & *Floral \* Flowlove*.
- (New) Added a highly-customable style.
- Depends on with/without speaker's name, brackets and quotes will be set automatically.
- The transparency of dialog box can be modified.
- Whatever the aspect ratio of background image is, the output picture will be 1280*720 in ScaleAspectFit.
